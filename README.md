<h1>Welcome to the Typescript Node/Express boilerplate on Docker/Docker Compose!! <h1>

<br>

<p>To USE:</p>
<br/>

<p>Make sure Docker and Docker compose is installed (I mean I know you knew that)</p>

<p>npm run install</p>

<p>npm run install-app  (to build containers)</p>

<p>npm run serve (to launch application up from docker container)</p>

<p>client -> localhost:8080</p>

<p>server -> localhost:3000</p>

<p> I might include React or Vue within this boilerplate at a later time</p>
